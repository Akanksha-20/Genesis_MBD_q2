The suspension system for one wheel of an old-fashioned
pickup truck is illustrated in figure 2. The mass of the vehicle is m1 and the mass of
the wheel is m2. The suspension spring has a spring constant k1 and the tire had the
spring constant k2. The damping constant of the shock absorber is b. Obtain the
mathematical model which represent the vehicle response to bump in the road and
simulate it for 100 sec. Create a dummy input signal to represent the bumpy road using
MATLAB program.
